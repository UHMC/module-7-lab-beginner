| Difficulty | Completing the assignment is easy, as it is just deploying a pre-made, hello-world contract. |
| Strengths | The strength of this assignment is that it allows students to get exposed to technology that they hear about often (blockchain) and is a starting point for further work. |
| Weaknesses | It may be difficult for students to extend their first smart contract. They might require more in-depth knowledge not provided here. |
| Dependencies | Provided hello-world code and internet access (for use of [the Remix IDE][Remix]). |
| Variants | Could be used to introduce Smart Contracts in any course setting. |

## Assignment Instructions
1. Copy the code and paste into [Remix at remix.ethereum.org][Remix].
